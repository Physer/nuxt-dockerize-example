# The builder stage
# This stage is responsible for:
# 1. Installing the necessary dependencies
# 2. Building the NuxtJS application
# 3. Bundling the necessary external packages into a standalone build

# Use Docker Buildkit for faster build times (https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/)
ENV DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

# Create a place in the container to process the NuxtJS application in
WORKDIR /app
# Copy all the files (excluding those defined in the .dockerignore file)

# Build the NuxtJS application, including devDependencies and create a production build
RUN npm ci && \

# The runner stage
# This is the final image that will be used when running the Docker container
# It's responsible for:
# 1. Copying the necessary custom runtime files to the container
# 2. Copying the NuxtJS configuration
# 3. Copying the entire NuxtJS application (the .nuxt, .output and static folders)
# 4. Setting container variables
# 5. Defining the start-up command
